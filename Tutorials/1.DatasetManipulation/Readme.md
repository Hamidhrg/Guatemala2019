# **Dataset Manipulation**

## **Introduction**

In this section we will learn to download genetic sequence information from online databases (i.e. Genbank) and generate a dataset. Later on in following tutorials this dataset file will be aligned and converted to different alignment file formats. We will also learn here how to convert between different formats used in phylogenetic programs and the main differences between these formats.

## **Download the data**

You need to navigate using a web browser to the NCBI’s Genbank. Even if the [link]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) is not easy to remember, googling basically any keyword combination containing Genbank will bring you to NCBI quite easily. In Genbank each sequence entry has a unique identification code called ***accession number***. For this exercise, you need to download the sequences of the following accession numbers.

| # | Organism name | COI Acc. N. | EF1a Acc. N. |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |
| 6 |  |  |  |
| 7 |  |  |  |
| 8 |  |  |  |
| 9 |  |  |  |
| 10 |  |  |  |
| 11 |  |  |  |
| 12 |  |  |  |
| 13 |  |  |  |
| 14 |  |  |  |
| 15 |  |  |  |

Opening the [link]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) provided earlier you can see the following (slight differences may exist due to different web browsers and operating systems and the position of the planets and …).
