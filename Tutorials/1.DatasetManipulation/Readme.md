# **Dataset Manipulation**

## **Introduction**

In this section we will learn to download genetic sequence information from online databases (i.e. Genbank) and generate a dataset. Later on in following tutorials this dataset file will be aligned and converted to different alignment file formats. We will also learn here how to convert between different formats used in phylogenetic programs and the main differences between these formats.

## **Download the data**

You need to navigate using a web browser to the NCBIâ€™s Genbank. Even if the [link]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) is not easy to remember, googling basically any keyword combination containing Genbank will bring you to NCBI quite easily. In Genbank each sequence entry has a unique identification code called ***accession number***. For this exercise, you need to download the sequences of the following accession numbers.
