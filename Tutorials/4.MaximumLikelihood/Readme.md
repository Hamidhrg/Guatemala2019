Part I: In this tutorial, we wiil analyse the butterfly dataset with with one of the fastest maximum-likelihood based phylogenetic program [IQ-TREE](http://www.iqtree.org) ([Nguyen et al. 2015](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/32/1/268/2925592)). IQ-TREE for Windows, MacOSX and Linux can be downloaded [here](http://www.iqtree.org/#download), you can install it on your personal computer (optional).
