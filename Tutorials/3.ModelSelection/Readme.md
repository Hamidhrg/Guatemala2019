# **Model Selection**


In the other two tutorials you have learned to download various gene sequences from Genbank and align and concatenate them to create the dataset we want to work on for the rest of the workshop. You also heard about differences between different file formats and saw how to create the needed formats. For the next tutorial, we are going to use *PartitionFinder* to find the best partitioning scheme for our dataset and also the best models for each partition.

First remember that our final dataset, `COI_EF1a_Wingless.fasta` was saved as a fasta format (If you did not manage to generate this file, go to *Molecular-systematics-course/Data/* and download *2_COI_EF1a_Wingless.fasta*). Now open *Aliview* and open this file. You should have something similar to this:
