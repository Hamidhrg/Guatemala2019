# **MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT**


From the first tutorial you have learned how to download data from Genbank, how to modify your fasta format sequence files and how to convert it to other sequence file formats. Just remember that the sequences are not aligned! It means that they have different lengths and nucleotide positions are not *homologous*! Here we are going to align our datasets using one of the most used aligners:


**MAFFT:** This is a multiple sequence alignment program for unix-like operating systems. We will be using an online version of the program at the following link: [https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/). But the installation of the program should be easy on all operating systems and optionally you can install it on your personal computer from [here](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/).

Open the link in a separate window.
