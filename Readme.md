# **Molecular Phylogenetics Course**

By Hamid Ghanavi from the Systematic Biology Group, Lund University

## **Introduction**

In this intense course we will introduce the basics of phylogenetics, covering both theory and practice. The idea behind the course is that the student gets an overview of the actual methods and learns through hands on exercises to use some of the most used computer programs to study the phylogeny of any group using genetic information.

Here I will upload all the files and information shared during the lectures!


### [Data used in the course](../../tree/master/Data/)

Here you will find the files we create during the course. (If at some point you are at a loss because your attempts to produce the results for the next step, here you can find the files you will need for next steps so you can keep up with the class.)
