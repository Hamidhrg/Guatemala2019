## Programs

* **MAFFT:** This is a multiple sequence alignment program for unix-like operating systems. We will be using an online version of the program at the following link: [https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/). But the installation of the program should be easy on all operating systems and optionally you can install it on your personal computer from [here](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/).

* **AliView:** To visualize sequence alignments, the software [AliView](http://www.ormbunkar.se/aliview/) ([Larsson 2014](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/30/22/3276/2391211)) is recommended. The installation of AliView is described at [http://www.ormbunkar.se/aliview/](http://www.ormbunkar.se/aliview/) and should be possible on all operating systems.

* **PartitionFinder:**

* **RAxML:**

* **IQ-TREE:** The IQ-TREE version 1.7 (currently available only as beta) or greater will be required as earlier versions did not allow the calculations of gene and site concordance factors. The latest versions of IQ-TREE for Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows can be found on [https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE/releases](https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE/releases). To install IQ-TREE on any of these systems, download the version for your operating system, and decompress this file on your machine if necessary. In the decompressed directory, you'll find a subdirectory named `bin` and inside of this subdirectory should be a file named `iqtree` or `iqtree.exe`.
	
* **FigTree:** The program [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) by Andrew Rambaut is a very intuitive and useful tool for the visualization and (to a limited extent) manipulation of phylogenies encoded in [Newick](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html) format. Executables for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows are provided on [http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).

* **BEAST2:** The BEAST2 package, including BEAUti, BEAST2 itself, TreeAnnotator, and other tools can be downloaded from the BEAST2 website [https://www.beast2.org](https://www.beast2.org). As all these programs are written in Java, compilation is not required, and all programs should work on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows. I recommend downloading, where possible, the program versions that include the Java Runtime Environment, which may prevent conflicts with Java versions that may already be installed on your machine.<br>

* **Tracer:** Just like BEAST2, Tracer is written in Java and should work on your system without problems. The program can be downloaded for Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows from [http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/). The file with the extension `.dmg` is for Mac OS X, the one with the extension `.tgz` is for Linux, and the Windows version is the file ending in `.zip`.
